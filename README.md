# CV on the Cloud

The aim of this project is to develop and provide state-of-the-art AI tool, putting the latest machine learning technologies to work for the Users. With its ability to handle compute and data analytics at any scale, Cloud computing accelerates the capabilities of machine learning to the next level.

## Introduction

During the last years, the nature of the Internet was constantly changing from a place used to read web pages to an environment that allows end-users to run software applications. Interactivity and collaboration have become the keywords of the new web content. This new environment supports the creation of a new generation of applications that are able to run on a wide range of hardware devices, like mobile phones or PDAs, while storing their data inside the cloud.

Artificial Intelligence is changing the face of a lot many industries. Image processing and Computer Vision have helped the world in solving problems that could not be done before. This project focuses on solving one such problem. It mainly focuses on using Artificial Intelligence to identify digits (0 to 9) by applying cutting-edge image processing techniques on the image of a digit. This project has the potential to change millions of lives all around the world and help numerous industries work better.
